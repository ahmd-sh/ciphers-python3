Cryptography- Ciphers in Python3
================================

These are a few ciphers made using [Python 3.6.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-366/), for a school assignment and for practicing python.


Prerequisites
-------------

-Python 3.7

-A python compatible IDE (eg. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/))


Disclaimer
----------

These ciphers work for as many cases as I could test, but that doesn't mean they are perfect in any way. The code written might not include all the best practices and might not be the most optimized solution, but like I mentioned earlier I am still learning python at the moment.
